# MagRock

**MagRock** is a Python Project for modeling and inversion of Scanning Magnetic Microscopy data and Rock magnetism.

> **_NOTE_**: This project is in early stage of construction. üõ†Ô∏è

## Project goals

The main idea of this package is to use some Python libraries, such as [`numpy`](https://numpy.org), [`scipy`](https://scipy.org), and others, for constructing the most tasks to solve modeling and inversion of magnetic data, mainly for rock magnetism and paleomagnetism applications. This project also intends to expand the knowledge about micromagnetic modeling algorithms by implementing them from scratch. The development of this package aims to provide more tools to research everything (or almost everything) related to these topics.


## Related topics

* Forward modeling for magnetic microscopy data using the adequate scale and units to simulate this data set.
* Inversions algorithms to estimate the main physical parameters (*i.e.*, the magnetization distribution) along rock samples.
* Provide the opportunity for contributions (anyone interested in this project is welcome) of doing research and learning from scratch.
* New methods for instrumental calibration, mainly for new acquisition structures, data types, and different magnetic sensors.
* Development of an Open Source tool for processing and interpreting magnetic microscopy data.
* Implementation of micromagnetic modeling algorithms for a step-by-step sample code.
